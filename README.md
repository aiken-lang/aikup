# aikup

A CLI for managing multiple versions of Aiken.

## Features

## Why?

As Aiken develops and new versions are released some
projects may not be able to immediately update. One reason
why is that perhaps code generation produces slightly different
compiled code between versions thus changing your script hash
and address. This is likely to be a common situation and developers
are likely to work across various Aiken projects all potentially using
different versions of the compiler. Considering this, it makes sense
to provide an official way to manage multiple versions of Aiken.
